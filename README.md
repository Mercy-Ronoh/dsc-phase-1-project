# Movie Industry Analysis at Microsoft 

## Name: Mercy Ronoh

## Overview

This project analyzes the movie industry data to provide insights to the Microsoft team which wants to venture into movie production. The objective is to explore the data through analysis, manipulation and exploration to come up with findings that can provide recommendations on where and how to kickstart the process. Microsoft can use this analysis to make decisions in regards to which type of genres to venture into, the budget they can pump into the project and the predictive timelines when they can release the movies/films into the target market. This will in turn led to high gross returns, therefore high profit margins.

## Problem Statement
Microsoft is venturing into the lucrative movie-making industry, but they lack a clear starrting point. Their new movie studio is eager to dive in. Unfortunately, Microsoft has no prior knowledge of the movie industry and might have challenges moving forward blindly in creating content.
Through analysis of the recent data and practicies that are foundational for a profitable venture, I have recommended essential features that Microsoft's movie studio can incorporate for maximum revenue generation.

The main factors  I have focused on are:

1. The genre type that are most successful.
2. The budget that can result to better gross returns.
3. The seasons when release can generate high gross returns.

Using the data, have described patterns, made predictions and decisions to creating a lucratibe movie industry.This analysis equips Microsoft with the knowledge needed to make well-informed strides into the film industry. 

### The Data
I sourced data from four primary datasets to comprehensively analyze the film industry:

1. IMDB Data: movies produced, including details on production budgets, revenues, genres, and ratings.

2. Box Office Mojo Data: encompassing domestic, international, and worldwide box office earnings, genres, and more.

3. Rotten Tomatoes Data: Access to audience and critic ratings, reviews, and related insights.

4. The Numbers Data: Data from a reputable movie industry data provider, offering information on box office revenues, budgets, genres, and more for the top 100 movies per year.

These datasets collectively informed my analysis of the film industry's key success factors and guided recommendations for Microsoft's entry into movie production.


## Methods

The methodology followed started by importing data from the zipped Data folder, followed by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values using statistical techniques.It comprised of data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and data visualization to identify key factors for success in the movie industry. Descriptive statistics and visualizations were then employed to reveal industry trends and highlight attributes common to high-grossing films. This comprehensive approach enabled the extraction of valuable insights and informed data-driven recommendations for success in the movie industry.
### Results

To maximize box office revenue, movie titles should be released during the first peak season between April and July, as well as the second peak season in November and December.

## Conclusions

Conclusion
In conclusion, the focus should be on producing the top five genres with the highest counts, which are the most common in this dataset:

Adventure, Animation, Comedy Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi Comedy Comedy, Drama Comedy, Drama, Romance

Based on the statistics, the mean budget for producing titles in the Adventure,Animation,Comedy' genre is approximately 75.69 million, while for Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi as it it is about 90.82 million.

Optimal budgets for achieving successful outcomes vary, with an optimal budget of around 125 million for Adventure,Animation,Comedy and 410 million for Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi.

Analyzing the plot, the regression line illustrates a general increase in gross amounts as the production budget increases. This indicates that a higher production budget tends to result in higher box office returns, interpreted as world gross revenue.

Furthermore, our analysis of release months suggests that for a movie title to achieve high gross amounts, it should be released between April and July, which marks the first peak season, with a second peak occurring between November and December.

In light of these findings, Microsoft should consider breaking into the movie industry with strategic insights. Additionally, it's worth noting that top-performing studios like BV (Buena Vista), Universal, Fox, Warner Brothers, and Sony have shown remarkable success in generating substantial total gross revenue, with BV leading at approximately $79,317 million. Microsoft could explore benchmarking against these industry leaders and consider personnel hiring from these studios to leverage their expertise and further enhance its prospects in the movie industry."
